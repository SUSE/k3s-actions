# k3s Actions

This repository contains a set of GitHub Actions for working with k3s.

## Consuming the Actions release

It's encouraged to use the latest released version in this repository, but we
don't enforce it via a `v{version}` branch as commonly seen in other GitHub
Actions. Instead, [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/github-actions/) can be
used to bump Actions in a repository to its latest version.
